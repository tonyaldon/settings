# About
`settings` pools all my user linux configuration.

This configuration works on linux ubuntu 16.04 LTS (maybe later
release too but not tested).

Meaning of the directories:
1. `emacs.d` contains my emacs configuration,
2. `i3` contains my i3 configuration,
3. `keyboard-layout` contains my keyboard layout,
4. `uconfig` contains other user configuration files.

# Motivation 
1. Good management of my workspace to work efficiently.
2. Share my setting system

# Installation

Go to path/to/this/repository, make `install.sh` executable and run
it.

To install the keyboard layout see the readme of keyboard-layout
directory.
